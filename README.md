Modern OTP TextField with Jetpack Compose
Introduction
This project showcases a modern OTP TextField implementation in Android using Jetpack Compose. The OTP TextField is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for entering one-time passwords. With features like validity checks, input formatting, and state management, it offers developers a flexible and scalable solution for integrating OTP input fields into their apps.

How It Works
OTP Input Field
Compose UI:
The OTP TextField is created using Row and individual TextField components, allowing users to type OTP digits one by one.

Validation Logic:

Validates the OTP in real-time by checking its length and ensuring all characters are numeric.
Displays a message below the field indicating the OTP's status.
State Management:

The UI observes changes in the State provided by a ViewModel.
The ViewModel contains the business logic for OTP handling and validation.
